==460653== NVPROF is profiling process 460653, command: python ./test.nccl.bistabcg.qcu-np2.py
==460653== Warning: Unified Memory Profiling is not supported on the current configuration because a pair of devices without peer-to-peer support is detected on this multi-GPU setup. When peer mappings are not available, system falls back to using zero-copy memory. It can cause kernels, which access unified memory, to run slower.
